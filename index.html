                <h3>From Drummer to Digital Architect</h3>
                <p>
                    My creative journey began at 13, filming drum covers and discovering the intersection of rhythm and visual narrative. Over 15 years, that passion evolved into a comprehensive creative and technical practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I bridge multiple worlds: crafting cinematic stories that move audiences, engineering audio experiences that resonate deeply, and building digital systems that power innovation. Each discipline informs the others, creating a unique perspective on creative technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether I'm directing a wedding film, mixing a live show, or architecting enterprise solutions, my commitment remains the same: excellence in execution, collaboration in process, and impact in outcome.
